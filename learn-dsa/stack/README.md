# Stack
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed, similar to stacking platesâ€”you take the top one first.

## Main Operations
- Push: Add an item to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove the item from the top of the stack.

## Key Characteristics
- LIFO Order: Items are removed in reverse order of how they were added.
- Top of the Stack: Only the top item is accessible for both adding and removing.

## Where Stacks Are Used
Stacks are useful in many scenarios, like:
- Undo Functionality: Keeps track of the most recent actions for quick reversal.
- Expression Evaluation: Used to evaluate or parse expressions in programming (e.g., converting infix to postfix notation).
