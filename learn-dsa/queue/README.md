# Queue
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first item added to the queue is the first one to be removed, like a line at a store.

## Main Operations
Enqueue: Add an item to the back of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove an item from the front of the queue.

## Key Characteristics
- FIFO Order: Items are processed in the order they arrive.
- Front and Rear: We track the front (where items are removed) and the rear (where items are added).

## Where Queues Are Used
Queues are common in situations like:

- Task Scheduling: Processes are handled in the order they arrive.
- Data Buffers: Temporary storage where items are processed one at a time, like in streaming or print jobs.
