# Linked List
A Linked List is a type of data structure where items, called nodes, are connected like a chain. Each node has two main parts:

- Data: Holds the information we want to store.
- Link: Points to the next node in the list.

Unlike arrays, linked lists don’t need to be stored in a single block of memory. Instead, each node points to where the next one is stored, creating a linked path.

## Types of Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List: Each node points only to the next node.
- Doubly Linked List: Each node has two links—one to the next node and one to the previous one.
- Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first, forming a loop.

## Why Use Linked Lists?
- Flexible Size: They can grow or shrink as needed.
- Easy to Insert or Delete: Especially useful for adding or removing items at the beginning or end.

## Common Actions
- Add: Insert a new node at a specific spot.
- Remove: Delete a node from a specific spot.
- Visit: Go through each node to see what’s inside.
