# Data Structure and Algorithm with Code Example
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Learning Journey repository! This repository is a personal project to document and track my progress as I dive deep into DSA concepts, implementations, and practical applications.

## Purpose
The primary aim of this repository is to:
- Organize and structure my learning by creating individual directories for each DSA topic.
- Enhance understanding by writing detailed notes to clarify each concept.
- Practice and demonstrate by implementing code examples that show how each data structure or algorithm works

## Learning Approach
To make the most of this journey, I’m following a step-by-step approach for each DSA topic:
- Understanding the Basics: Starting with an overview of each topic to understand its theory and real-world applications.
- Deep Dive into Theory: Writing detailed notes that cover the inner workings, key properties, and potential use cases.
- Hands-on Coding: Implementing the concept through code examples to reinforce learning and apply theory in practice.
- Problem Solving and Optimization: Attempting problems that use the DSA concept to enhance problem-solving skills and consider efficiency.

## Repositories Structure
Each DSA topic will have its own sub-directory, containing:
- README.md: A detailed note explaining the concept, with examples and illustrations where helpful.
- Code Examples: Code files implementing the topic in one or more programming languages, usually with comments and sample outputs to make the code easy to follow.

*Example structure:*
```txt
├── Arrays
│   ├── README.md       # Contains notes and explanations for Arrays
│   └── array_example.py # Code examples for array operations
├── LinkedList
│   ├── README.md       # Notes on Linked Lists
│   └── linkedlist_example.py # Code examples for linked list operations
└── Sorting
    ├── README.md       # Sorting algorithms overview
    └── sorting_example.py # Implementation of various sorting algorithms
```

## Technologies Used
I’ll primarily use Python for code examples due to its readability and extensive library support. In the future, I may add implementations in Java and C++ to compare performance and efficiency across languages.

## Current Progress
- Linked list
- Stack (WIP)
- Queue (WIP)

## Goals
Through this project, I intend to:
- Build a strong foundation in fundamental DSA concepts.
- Document my journey as a self-paced resource I can refer to later.
- Share my progress with others who might find it helpful.
